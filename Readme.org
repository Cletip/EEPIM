#+title: EasyEmacsPKM

* Purpose

This guide is designed to provide a foundation for understanding Emacs and its utility through a user-oriented pre-configured setup.

* Installation

** Download and Install Git

*Windows:*
1. Download the Git installer from the official Git website: [[https://gitforwindows.org/][git download]].
2. Run the downloaded `.exe` file to start the installer.
3. Follow the installation prompts. Make sure to choose options that add Git to your PATH, which makes it accessible from the command prompt.
4. To verify installation, open Command Prompt and type `git --version`. It should return the installed version of Git.

*macOS:*
1. The easiest way to install Git on macOS is to install the Xcode Command Line Tools. Open a terminal and type:
   #+begin_src sh
   xcode-select --install
   #+end_src
2. Click 'Install' when prompted to install the command line developer tools.
3. After installation, verify Git is installed by typing `git --version` in the terminal.

*Linux:*
1. Open a terminal.
2. Update your package list using the package manager, then install Git.
   - For Debian/Ubuntu:
     #+begin_src sh
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install git
     #+end_src
     
   - For Fedora:
     #+begin_src sh
     sudo dnf install git
     #+end_src

   - For Arch Linux:
     #+begin_src sh
     sudo pacman -S git
     #+end_src
     
3. Verify the installation by typing `git --version` in the terminal.

** Download and Install Emacs

- Visit the official GNU Emacs website: [https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
- Choose the version suitable for your operating system. It is recommended to download at least version 28 for compatibility with most packages.
- Follow the installation instructions on the website for your specific OS.

** Set Up the PKM

*Windows, macOS, and Linux:*

1. First, ensure that you have Git installed (as per the instructions above).
2. Do the same for Emacs (as per the instructions above).
3. Open your command line interface (Command Prompt for Windows, Terminal for macOS and Linux).
4. Navigate to your home directory:
   - *Windows*:
     #+begin_src sh
     cd %USERPROFILE%
     #+end_src
   - *macOS/Linux*:
     #+begin_src sh
     cd ~
     #+end_src
     
5. If you already have a `.emacs.d` directory and you want to replace it, you should rename or remove the existing directory:
   - *All OS*:
     #+begin_src sh
     mv .emacs.d .emacs.d.backup
     #+end_src
     
6. Clone the repository:
   #+begin_src sh
   git clone https://github.com/Cletip/projetZZ2.git .emacs.d
   #+end_src
   
   This command creates a new `.emacs.d` directory with the contents of the repository.

7. Once the cloning is complete, you can start Emacs, and it should load the new configuration from the cloned `.emacs.d` directory.

This method ensures that you have the latest version of the Emacs configuration from the `Cletip/.emacs.d` repository, set up and ready to use on your machine. Be sure to replace the repository URL with the actual URL if `Cletip/.emacs.d` is just a placeholder for the real repository.

** Launch Emacs

- Open Emacs by searching for it in your start menu or using a command line interface.
- The first time you start Emacs, it may take some time to load as it configures itself based on the `.emacs.d` setup.
- Explore the default interface or follow additional setup instructions specific to the configuration you chose.

* Update

1. Open your command line interface:
   Windows: Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.
   macOS/Linux: Open Terminal.
2. Navigate to your .emacs.d directory in your home directory: All OS:
    #+begin_src sh
   cd ~/.emacs.d
     #+end_src

3. Pull the latest changes from the repository. This command fetches the updated data from the remote repository (e.g., GitHub) and then merges it into your local repository: All OS:
   #+begin_src sh
     git pull
   #+end_src

4. Restart Emacs to apply the updates.
