#+title: Personal Configuration
#+auto_tangle: t

This file is used only for user configuration. It is loaded after config.org. Therefore, all modifications made here are loaded afterwards.

This file is a .org file. At each save, the file is "exported"/tangle in a .el file (with the line auto_tangle: t). This is this file that is loaded by Emacs. Restart another Emacs to take in account the modification.

A simplistic example of structure might be like this :

* Begin

Keep this to be sure that this file is loaded.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes

  (message "Personnal configuration loading...")

#+end_src


* Configuration of X

Some text here.

** Configuration of XY

More text here.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes

  ;; some code here

#+end_src

** Etc

* Configuration of Z...

* End

Keep this to be sure that this file is loaded.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes

  (message "Personnal configuration loaded")

#+end_src
